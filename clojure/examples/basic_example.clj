;; ============================================================================
;; 1. Define custom tools
;; ============================================================================

;; Option A: Using the deftool macro for concise definitions
(def facts
  {"javascript" "JavaScript was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995."
   "node"       "Node.js lets you run JavaScript outside the browser using the V8 engine."
   "clojure"    "Clojure was created by Rich Hickey and first released in 2007."})

(deftool lookup-fact
  "Returns a fun fact about a given topic."
  {:type       "object"
   :properties {:topic {:type        "string"
                        :description "Topic to look up (e.g. 'javascript', 'node', 'clojure')"}}
   :required   ["topic"]}
  [args _invocation]
  (let [topic (clojure.string/lower-case (or (:topic args) ""))]
    (get facts topic (str "No fact stored for " topic "."))))

;; Option B: Using define-tool function directly
(def get-time-tool
  (define-tool "get_current_time"
               "Returns the current server time."
               nil  ;; no parameters
